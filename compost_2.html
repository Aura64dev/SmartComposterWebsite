						<h3>Problem</h3>
						<p>Composting, which is widely accepted as an effective way to limit food waste, takes a lot of space and necessitates constant monitoring.  Many people do not possess the time or space required to maintain a well-developed compost pile. </p>

							<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/W36k6wMs/old-compost.jpg" alt="" /></span>Every year, the average household throws away hundreds of pounds of food that could be reused in a more productive manner. This level of food waste is unsustainable and it is hurting the environment. One common and effective way to limit and lower the amount of food waste produced in a household is to begin a compost pile, which can be used to fertilize some kind of vegetable garden to further promote sustainability. The issue with this is that composting is currently pretty inacessible. It takes a lot of time and a lot of effort to produce true, effective compost. Many people don't have the space or time required for this, which means it is hard to limit food waste. As of right now, the only composting aids available are upwards of $100 each and do very little to actually make composting easier. The Smart Composter aims to help fix this issue by providing a low cost, low space, low time commitment alternative to traditional composting methods.</p>
							<h3>Solution</h3>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/xdpBzWv8/updated-description-footer.jpg" alt="" /></span>For compost to be as effective as possible, there are a few key components that must be regulated. The moisture level of the soil has to be kept under control; spinning and mixing the compost pile helps with that. The PH level of the compost also needs to be regulated, this is accompished by adding leaves to the pile periodically. The pile's temperature also must remain at a fairly high level. By automating these functions, it is possible to completely remove the human aspect of the composting process. This makes it easier for people with very little spare time to maintain a composting process. </p>
