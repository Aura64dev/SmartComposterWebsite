					<h4>Etan Doft- Wiring, Research, General Scape-Goatery</h4>
					<p>Etan (Top Left) is the greatest lego master builder of our time and is also good at wiring. Everything that didn't work with the project was his fault. Everything that worked was also his fault.</p>
					<h4>Zane Roshe- Construction, 3d Printing, Math</h4>
					<p>Zane (Second from top left) is a genius behind a 3d printer. Sadly, he is not a genius anywhere else. We still love him anyway as he designed and built pretty much the whole project.</p>
					<h4>Donny DeFala- Code, Concept, Hair</h4>
					<p>Donny (Top Center, holding trophy) is the most important member of the team, and no that isn't just because he is writing this website at this very moment. Without him, there would be an underwhelming amount of facial hair, and no one wants that.</p>
					<h4>Josh Schulman- Research, Managment, Keeping-in-line</h4>
					<p>Schulman (top right) did a massive amount of work for this project and his contribution cannot be understated. It would not be finished without his relentless nagging to stick to the gantt chart, or in general.</p>
