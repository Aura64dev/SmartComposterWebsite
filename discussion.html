					<h4>Process/Procedure</h4>
					<p>To create our product we did three types of research- we looked into the specific aspects of a compost pile that need to be taken care of so we knew what specifically we needed the Smart Composter to do. We also looked into the market for this product, specifically whether or not something like it already existed. What we found was that all the composting aids did nothing to reduce the time or space commitment and essentially were glorified trash cans that cost upwards of $100. We also talked to people we knew who currently have or previously had compost piles to see what the biggest problem areas were- a close friend of one of the team members said that when he forgot to add leaves to his compost regularly it turned into a brown sludge- which directly resulted in the implementation of the leaf delivery system. When talking to people about composting we also reached out to the Sustainability Program Manager at UConn, who gave us a few suggestions for further development as well as told us we had an “ingenious solution to addressing many of the perceived challenges with composting”. We had a lot of phases of our design such as a website based project, an app based project, and a carboard box with rulers duct taped to a DC motor. There was a lot on the cutting room floor but also a lot being added right up until the last day we were in school, and even afterwards we were still evolving the project.
					</p>
					<h4>Reflections</h4>
					<p>We had a hard time determining whether or not to use an app/website to monitor our project as well as figuring out how to get leaves into the compost without overcomplicating our project or drastically increasing its footprint.
					</p>
					<h4>Future Work/Improvements</h4>
					<p>Future improvements on the composter could include a built in bag for easy removal/storage, solar or battery powered options, or even a small built in herb garden. One idea we would love to move forward with would be varying sizes of composters for industrial use as well as education, or for larger/smaller personal gardens.
